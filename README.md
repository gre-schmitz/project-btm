GDP Now [https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow#Tab2]
The GDPNow forecast model provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates the real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the United States for the current quarter. The GDPNow model estimate is on a quarter-over-quarter basis, meaning it forecasts the percentage change in GDP from the previous quarter to the current quarter on an annualized basis.

Quarter-over-quarter annualized growth rates are commonly used in the U.S. to provide a sense of the GDP's growth pace as if the quarterly rate continued for a full year. This approach helps smooth out the seasonal variations and provides a more consistent basis for comparison across quarters. Note that the Federal Reserve's Summary of Economic Projections typically includes forecasts for GDP on a year-over-year (YoY) basis.
